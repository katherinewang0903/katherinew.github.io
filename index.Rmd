Hello! I'm Katherine, and welcome to my personal website. I'm a curious soul with a love for data science, exploring new places, and spending time with my furry best friend. My research interests lie in **cancer epidemiology**, where I work to understand how lifestyle factors influence cancer risk.

### Golf
One of my favorite activities is playing golf. I find it both challenging and relaxing, and it's a great way to spend time in the fresh air and connect with friends.

### Traveling
I absolutely love traveling! I've been fortunate enough to visit over 20 countries, experiencing new cultures, tasting delicious cuisines, and making wonderful memories. There's nothing quite like the thrill of exploring a new city or discovering a hidden gem.

### Pet Dog: Mochi 
Meet Mochi! Mochi is my 7-year-old mini schnauzer, and he's my bundle of joy. Mochi loves long walks, playing fetch, and making new friends at dog park. Everyone likes his long and beautiful eyelashes! wer~
